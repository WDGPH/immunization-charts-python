"""Integration tests for pipeline step contracts and artifact consistency.

Verifies handoffs between steps by testing that data survives serialization
and that each step's output satisfies the next step's requirements.

Covered boundaries:
- Artifact JSON round-trip (Step 2 output → all downstream steps)
- Preprocess → QR Generation (Step 2 → Step 3)
- Notice Generation template data (Step 4 input contract)
- Encryption / Bundling mutual exclusivity (Steps 7–8 config contract)
- PHIX school validation (Step 2 feature toggle → artifact schema contract)

Per TESTING_STANDARDS.md: integration tests should verify
"Output from Step N is valid input to Step N+1" and
"JSON artifact schema consistency across steps".
