# PDF Validation: Markers + Measurements

This document explains how we validate compiled PDFs using invisible template markers and measurements plus pypdf text extraction. It covers the marker format, the rules we enforce, configuration, outputs, and how to extend the system.

## What we validate

We validate layout and structure using rules configured in `config/parameters.yaml` under `pdf_validation.rules`:

- `exactly_two_pages`: Ensure each notice PDF has exactly 2 pages.
- `signature_overflow`: Ensure the signature block ends on page 1.
- `envelope_window_1_125`: Ensure the contact table height fits a 1.125-inch envelope window.

Each rule can be configured to `disabled`, `warn`, or `error`.

Example:

```yaml
pdf_validation:
  # Validation rules: "disabled" (skip check), "warn" (log only), or "error" (halt pipeline)
  rules:
    exactly_two_pages: warn         # Ensure PDF has exactly 2 pages (notice + immunization record)
    signature_overflow: warn        # Signature block not on page 1
    envelope_window_1_125: warn     # Contact table fits in envelope window (1.125in max height)
```

## How the markers work

The Typst templates embed invisible text markers that we can reliably extract from the compiled PDF text. We use two categories:

- MARKers: Boolean/positional markers
  - `MARK_END_SIGNATURE_BLOCK` — emitted at the end of the signature block. We scan pages for this marker to find the page where the signature block ends.
- MEASUREments: Numeric metrics in points
  - Format: `MEASURE_<NAME>:<value>` (e.g., `MEASURE_CONTACT_HEIGHT:81.0`). Values are in PostScript points. Conversion: 72 points = 1 inch.

These markers are rendered invisibly in the PDF (e.g., zero-opacity/white/hidden), but remain extractable by text extraction. They should be ASCII and simple to ensure robust extraction across renderers.

### Example measurements we emit

- `MEASURE_CONTACT_HEIGHT` — The height of the contact information table on page 1 (in points). We convert this to inches and compare to the envelope window limit.
- `MARK_END_SIGNATURE_BLOCK` — A marker string included where the signature block ends.

## Extraction pipeline

Module: `pipeline/validate_pdfs.py`

Key functions:
- `extract_measurements_from_markers(page_text: str) -> dict[str, float]`
  - Parses all `MEASURE_...:<value>` markers from page text and returns a dict of measurements (in points).
- `validate_pdf_layout(pdf_path, reader, enabled_rules) -> (warnings, measurements)`
  - Uses `pypdf.PdfReader` to extract page text.
  - Locates `MARK_END_SIGNATURE_BLOCK` to determine `signature_page`.
  - Reads `MEASURE_CONTACT_HEIGHT` and converts to inches as `contact_height_inches`.
- `validate_pdf_structure(pdf_path, enabled_rules) -> ValidationResult`
  - Counts pages, adds `page_count` to `measurements`.
  - Applies page-count rule and then layout rules.

We centralize reading via `pypdf.PdfReader` and only extract plain text; we do not rely on PDF layout coordinates.

## Rules: logic and outputs

- exactly_two_pages
  - Logic: page_count must equal 2.
  - Warning message: `exactly_two_pages: has N pages (expected 2)`
  - Measurement included: `page_count: N`

- signature_overflow
  - Logic: Find the page containing `MARK_END_SIGNATURE_BLOCK`; it must be page 1.
  - Warning message: `signature_overflow: Signature block ends on page P (expected page 1)`
  - Measurement included: `signature_page: P`

- envelope_window_1_125
  - Logic: Extract `MEASURE_CONTACT_HEIGHT` on page 1; convert to inches. Must be <= 1.125 in.
  - Warning message: `envelope_window_1_125: Contact table height H.in exceeds envelope window (max 1.125in)`
  - Measurement included: `contact_height_inches: H`

## Outputs: console and JSON

Console summary includes per-rule status for all rules (including disabled), with pass/fail counts and severity labels. The output may omit the high‑level pass count and focus on rule lines when run via the orchestrator.

Example (current orchestrator output):

```
Validation rules:
  - envelope_window_1_125 [warn]: ✓ 5 passed
  - exactly_two_pages [warn]: ✓ 5 passed
  - signature_overflow [warn]: ✓ 5 passed

Detailed validation results: output/metadata/en_validation_<timestamp>.json
```

JSON summary is written to `output/metadata/{language}_validation_{run_id}.json` and has:

- `rule_results`: per-rule pass/fail with severity
- `results`: per-PDF details, warnings, and measurements

Example excerpt:

```json
{
  "rule_results": [
    {"rule_name": "exactly_two_pages", "severity": "warn", "passed_count": 5, "failed_count": 0},
    {"rule_name": "signature_overflow", "severity": "warn", "passed_count": 5, "failed_count": 0},
    {"rule_name": "envelope_window_1_125", "severity": "warn", "passed_count": 5, "failed_count": 0}
  ],
  "results": [
    {
      "filename": "en_notice_00001_...pdf",
      "warnings": [],
      "passed": true,
      "measurements": {
        "page_count": 2.0,
        "signature_page": 1.0,
        "contact_height_inches": 1.125
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Optional markerless validations

Markers are recommended for precision, but some validations can operate without them by scanning page text directly.

Example: Client ID presence check
- Goal: Ensure each generated PDF contains the expected client ID somewhere in the text.
- Approach: Use `pypdf.PdfReader` to extract text of all pages and search with a regex pattern for the formatted client ID (e.g., 10 digits, or a specific prefix/suffix).
- Failure condition: Pattern not found → emit a warning like `client_id_presence: ID 1009876543 not found in PDF text`.

Implementation notes:
- Keep patterns strict enough to avoid false positives (e.g., word boundaries: `\b\d{10}\b`).
- Normalize text if needed (strip spaces/hyphens) and compare both raw and normalized forms.
- Add the new rule key under `pdf_validation.rules` and include it in per‑rule summaries just like other rules.

This markerless approach is also suitable for checks like:
- Presence of required labels or headers.
- Language detection heuristics (e.g., a small set of expected words in FR/EN output).
- Date format sanity checks.

## Validator contracts: validate against artifacts, not filenames

**Core principle: Validate against the preprocessed artifact (source of truth), never against filenames (derived output).**

### Why
- Filenames are output from prior steps and can drift or be manually renamed.
- The preprocessed `clients.json` is the single source of truth: it represents the actual clients validated and processed through the pipeline.
- If validation uses a filename, a silent rename or data mismatch may go undetected.
- If validation uses the artifact, data consistency is guaranteed.

### How it works in practice

In step 6 (validation), the orchestrator:
1. Loads `preprocessed_clients_{run_id}.json` from `output/artifacts/`.
2. Builds a mapping: `filename -> expected_value` (e.g., client ID, sequence number).
3. Passes this mapping to `validate_pdfs.main(..., client_id_map=client_id_map)`.

Rules then validate against the mapping using artifact data as the source of truth.

### Example: client_id_presence rule

Current rule: Searches for any 10-digit number in the PDF text and compares to the expected client ID.

- Expected ID source: `client_id_map["en_notice_00001_1009876543.pdf"]` → `"1009876543"` (from artifact).
- Actual ID found: regex `\b(\d{10})\b` in extracted text.
- Validation: If found ≠ expected, emit warning.

This ensures every generated PDF contains the correct client ID, catching generation errors or data drift early.

## Why we prefer template‑emitted measurements over PDF distance math

We strongly prefer emitting precise measurements from the Typst template (via `measure()` and `MEASURE_...` markers) instead of inferring sizes by computing distances between two markers in extracted PDF text. Reasons:

- Deterministic geometry: Typst knows the actual layout geometry (line breaks, spacing, leading, table cell borders). Emitting a numeric measurement captures the truth directly.
- Robust to text extraction quirks: PDF text extraction can lose exact ordering, merge or split whitespace, and is affected by ligatures/kerning and font encodings. Geometry in points is stable; text streams are not.
- Locale‑safe: Measurements are invariant across languages (EN/FR) even as word lengths and hyphenation change.
- Unit consistency: We always emit PostScript points and convert with 72 pt = 1 in. No need for pixel/scale heuristics.
- Clear rule contracts: Rules assert against explicit metrics (e.g., `contact_height_inches <= 1.125`) instead of implicit heuristics (e.g., count lines, guess distances).
- Testability: Numeric outputs are easy to assert in unit tests and in JSON `measurements`.

When marker pairs are useful
- Presence/ordering checks (e.g., `MARK_END_SIGNATURE_BLOCK` on page 1) — use a boolean/positional marker.
- Avoid using two markers and computing a distance in the extracted text; prefer a single numeric `MEASURE_...` emitted by the template that already accounts for the exact box height/width.

Recommended Typst pattern (illustrative)

```typst
// Compute height of the contact block and emit an invisible measurement
#let contact_box = box(contact_table)
#let dims = measure(contact_box)
// dims.height is in pt; emit a plain ASCII marker for pypdf to read
// The text should be invisible (e.g., white on white or zero‑opacity) but extractable
MEASURE_CONTACT_HEIGHT: #dims.height

// Place the signature end marker where the block actually ends
MARK_END_SIGNATURE_BLOCK
```

Validator side (already implemented)
- Parse `MEASURE_CONTACT_HEIGHT:<points>` via `extract_measurements_from_markers()`.
- Convert to inches (`points / 72.0`) as `contact_height_inches`.
- Compare to configured threshold (e.g., 1.125in) and surface the actual value in warnings and JSON.

## Adding a new rule

1. Emit a marker in the Typst template:
   - For a numeric metric: output `MEASURE_<NAME>:<points>` (points are recommended for consistency).
   - For a position marker: insert a unique text token like `MARK_<SOMETHING>` at the desired location.
2. In `validate_pdfs.py`:
  - Extend `extract_measurements_from_markers` if needed (it already parses any `MEASURE_...:<value>` tokens).
  - Read the measurement or locate the marker in `validate_pdf_layout`.
  - Convert units as needed (use 72 points = 1 inch for inches).
  - Store the measurement using its natural Python type so downstream JSON preserves meaning (e.g., counts as `int`, dimensions as `float`, identifiers as `str`). The `ValidationResult.measurements` dict accepts `int | float | str`; adding other types should include a deliberate type hint update.
  - Add a warning message under the new rule key when conditions fail.
3. Add the rule to `config/parameters.yaml` under `pdf_validation.rules` with `disabled|warn|error`.
4. Add tests validating both the pass and fail paths, checking that `measurements` includes the new key with the expected value and type.

## Troubleshooting

- No markers found in text
  - Ensure the marker strings are plain ASCII and not removed by the template’s visibility settings.
  - Ensure text extraction is possible: pypdf reads the pages and returns text (some fonts/encodings may complicate extraction).
- Units confusion
  - `MEASURE_...` values should be in points; convert with `inches = points / 72.0`.
- False negatives for `signature_overflow`
  - Confirm `MARK_END_SIGNATURE_BLOCK` is emitted exactly where the signature block ends and not earlier.
- Missing measurements in JSON
  - Check that the rule is enabled and the markers are present on the expected page (page 1 for contact height).

## How to run

From the orchestrator (preferred):

```bash
uv run viper <input.xlsx> <en|fr>
```

Directly (advanced/testing):

```bash
# Validate all PDFs in a directory
uv run python -m pipeline.validate_pdfs output/pdf_individual
```

The validator writes JSON to `output/metadata` and prints a summary with per-rule pass/fail counts. Severity `error` will cause the pipeline to stop.
