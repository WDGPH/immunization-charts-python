**Subject:** Immunization Notice Automation Pilot – Next Steps

Dear [Recipient Name],

Thank you for your interest in piloting custom immunization notification letters!
This email provides details on a collaboration agreement, template options and data requirements.

The first phase of this collaboration is to complete a pilot. Pilots ideally occur outside of your actual immunization campaign. During the pilot we ensure the requirements for your immunization notices are met with our solution. For this we like to allocate up to 2 weeks for working together through any data format or quality issues and for refinement of the document layout – ideally over teams chat and ad hoc meetings as needed. We then ask for QA to be done on your health unit’s end by your subject matter experts, and ask to report back any detected issues as they are found. We take the learnings to improve code, data quality rules, and documentation for each successive pilot.

If going ahead with the operational usage of the solution – as long as the data is prepared and delivered to us in the same way as during the pilot, and the notice layout is not changed, the turnaround can be quite a bit quicker. We still like to allocate a week for this, and ask again that you do your own additional QA on the notices we provide back to you.
