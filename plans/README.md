# Plans Directory

This directory contains implementation plans for features developed with AI coding assistance.

## Purpose

- Document the reasoning behind implementations
- Provide context for code reviewers
- Help future contributors understand design decisions
- Track what has been implemented and what is planned

## Naming Convention

```
NNN-feature-name.md
```

Where `NNN` is a zero-padded sequence number.

## Plan Structure

Each plan should include:

1. **Problem Statement** - What problem does this solve?
2. **Solution** - High-level approach
3. **Implementation** - Files created/modified
4. **Design Decisions** - Key choices and rationale
5. **Testing** - How to verify it works
6. **Future Enhancements** - What could be added later
