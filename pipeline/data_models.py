    """Unified client record across all pipeline steps.

    This dataclass represents a single client (student) record passed through
    the entire pipeline. It contains all necessary information for:
    - Generating personalized notices
    - Creating QR codes
    - Encrypting PDFs
    - Batching outputs

    Fields
    ------
    sequence : str
        Zero-padded sequence number for the client (e.g., '00001').
    client_id : str
        Unique client identifier.
    language : str
        ISO 639-1 language code ('en' or 'fr'). Must be a valid Language enum value
        (see pipeline.enums.Language). Validated using Language.from_string() at entry
        points (CLI, configuration loading, preprocessing). All functions assume this
        field contains a valid language code; invalid codes should be caught before
        ClientRecord instantiation.

        - date_of_birth: Display format (e.g., "Jan 8, 2025")
        - date_of_birth_iso: ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
        - date_of_birth_display: Localized display format
        - age: Calculated age in years
        - over_16: Boolean flag for age >= 16
    school : Dict[str, Any]

    vaccines_due : Optional[str]
        Comma-separated string of vaccines due (display format).
    vaccines_due_list : Optional[List[str]]
        List of vaccine names/codes due.
    received : Optional[Sequence[Dict[str, object]]]
        List of vaccine records already received (structured data).
    metadata : Dict[str, object]
        Custom pipeline metadata (warnings, flags, etc.).
    qr : Optional[Dict[str, Any]]
        QR code information (if generated):
        - payload: QR code data string
        - filename: PNG filename
